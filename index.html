        <p>I aspire to be a software engineer. I have a passion for problem-solving and programming, and I am fascinated by technology and its capabilities. With the skills I develop during my career in software, I will become an entrepreneur and introduce my lifestyle app to the black community to help build confidence in the versatility of black hair. Once established, I hope to participate in additional community services such as mentorship and education. I eventually want to found a mentorship program for black girls without female role models and a voter education initiative in communities with less access to political education, starting with my hometown of Philadelphia. After building enough wealth to reinvest into my community, I plan to initiate a second career in real estate and learn how to successfully invest in providing more affordable, safe, and comfortable housing to those facing poverty or gentrification within their communities.</p>

		<ol>
			<li><h2>Software Engineer</h2>
			<p>I aspire to be a software engineer because I have a passion for coding, technology, problem-solving, and innovation. I also have several app ideas that I want to challenge myself to bring to life.</p></li>
			<li><h2>Educator</h2>
			<p>I want to be an educator because I would never had known about my ability to excel in computer science if my high school had not hada robotics team. I believer all children from underrepresented communities should be introduced to computer science early to remove the wariness people often have about programming.</p>
			<li><h2>Artist</h2>
			<p>I am a self-proclaimed artist who has always loved to physically manifest the ideas in my head. I do this by coding, drawing, and writing. I sell my artwork on digital marketplaces as well as share it with social media. I plan to release at least two books in my lifetime.</p>
